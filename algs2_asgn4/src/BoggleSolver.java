 * Name: Steve Dugaro 
 *
 * Compilation:  javac BoggleSolver.java
 * Execution:     java BoggleSolver dictionary-algs4.txt board4x4.txt  
 * Dependencies: algs4.jar BoggleTST.java BoggleBoard.java
 *
 * Write a program to play the word game Boggle
 * The Boggle game involves a board made up of 16 cubic dice, where each
 * die has a letter printed on each of its sides. At the beginning of the
 * game, the 16 dice are shaken and randomly distributed in a 4-by-4 tray
 * with only the top sides of the dice visible. The players compete to
 * accumulate points by building valid words out of the dice according
 * to the following rules:
 * 1 A valid word must be composed by following a sequence of adjacent
 *   diceâ€”two dice are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or 
 *   diagonal neighbors.
 * 2 A valid word can use each die at most once.
 * 3 A valid word must contain at least 3 letters.
 * 4 A valid word must be in the dictionary 
 * 5 Qu special case (counts as 2 letters)
 *
 * Words are scored according to their length
 * 0-2 0
 * 3-4 1
 * 5   2
 * 6   3
 * 7   5
 * 8+  11
 *
 * Write a Boggle Solver that finds ALL valid words for a given boggle
 * board using the given dictionary, with the following immutable data type
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - A natural/fast data structure for storing/searching dictionary is a trie.
 * - need a standard set data type to represent found words TreeSet/HashSet
 *   Note that a trie will replace the key so if it exists so its like a set.
 * - BoggleBoard is provided, familiarize
 * - Need a DFS to enumerate all simple paths in the boggle graph
 *   (all strings composed by following sequences of adjacent dice)
 * - ignore special case Qu for now
 * - implement !critical! backtracking optimization: (aka string search)
 *   when the current path corresponds to a string that is NOT a prefix
 *   of any word in the dictionary, there is no need to expand the path
 *   further. (trie pruning)
 * - Need a data structure for the dictionary that supports the operation 
 *   prefixQuery(P): given a prefix is there any word in the dict that
 *   starts with P? (trie APIs -- dont have this need to extend )
 *   
 * Optimizations:
 * - can dictionary be represented more efficiently? Alphabet is A-Z
 *   * R or R^2 branching makes a lot of sense for an english dictionary
 *   * R each [a b .... y z] starts a trie (should use at least this!)
 *   * R^2 each [aa ab ac ...  zx zy zz] starts a trie 
 *   * R^2 is prob best since boggle deals with 3 letter words or higher
 *   * NOTE: there is a 2 letter dictionary to test R^2 branching.
 *   * branching off a hashmap its easy enough to key R or R^2 given
 *   * the hash value of the first char or sum of 2 chars.
 * - doing a prefixQuery(Pn) is almost identical to Pn-1; 1 letter longer
 * - non recursive implementatin of prefixQuery()
 * - precompute the Boggle Graph (set of cubes adjacent to each cube)
 *   but keep lighter than a heavyweight graph object as speed is key!
 *   
 * Notes
 * - Generics and arrays dont mix:
 *   One could create an object array and cast it such as
 *     boggleGraph = (TST<Integer>[]) new Object[26];
 *   This compiles but throws ClassCastException.
 *   Its more convenient and just as fast to use a hashmap anyway
 *   
 * - There are various implementations of a sets, all of which are simply
 *   symbol tables without the associated value. A SET is implemented with
 *   a balanced binary tree which is a classic/efficient implementation
 *   for symbol tables. The "ultimate" symbol table data structure are
 *   balanced search trees => all operations O(lnN) and ordered. Traversal
 *   is O(N) since each node in the tree must be be visited once. 
 *   - Hash Tables are another approach to symbol tables which can do better.
 *   Linear Probing is best for use with csv lookups/sets/dicts per lecture
 *   - How are we using the set? to just maintain a unique list of words.
 *   Clobbering a key doesn't matter; order doesnt matter; get words fast. 
 *   Return all words O(N). Insert O(1) vs O(lgN)
 *   - So a java.util HashSet is preferred over TreeSet for our needs
 *   - HashSet: O(1) add,remove,contains : not ordered
 *   iteration performance depends on the initial capacity... specify about
 *   twice the size you expect the set to grow
 *   - TreeSet: O(lgN) add remove contains: ordered with ordered ops
 *   ascencing/decending natural sort order specificed in the constructor
 *   - Adding nulls to a TreeSet throws NullPointerException, nulls ok in HashSet
 *   - initial capacity of HashSet?
 *   - 64 words on a 2x2 board, 10305 on a 3x3 board, 12e+6 on a 4x4 board
 *   - this represents all possible paths, and is consistent when all chars 
 *     on the board are unique. This can be less for us when we count the
 *     number of words in our word set as we don't store duplicates. But we
 *     can precalculate this maximal size for our hashset.
 *   - 3^N where N is the number of tiles is an increasingly loose guess
 *   - The reality is that the number of words we can accumilate on the
 *     boggle board is never more than the number of words in the dictionary
 *     since we compare against the dictionary to accept a word. So the size
 *     of our word hashMap can be the min(||dictionary||,3^N)  
 *   
 *   
 * - Exploring the Boggle board is a 2D DFS Maze Exploration problem.
 *   We cant use/visit the same dice twice thats an invalid path
 *   This is the Boggle Graph, but we don't need a heavy graph object to
 *   search it. For each dice we have a posn/char and we need to get at all
 *   the adjacent characters to begin forming a word (at most 8 neighbor dice
 *   depending on whether at a boundary), then recurse for each of those.
 *   At each die we can move in 8 possible directions unless at a boundary.
 *   - Each die forms a set of paths/words, which we can accumilate in a set
 *   as we traverse the Boggle Graph.
 *   - We start with the base case which is the first dice at posn (i,j)=(0,0) 
 *   DepthFirstPaths: (1D)
 *     int p
 *     boolean marked[]
 *     dfs(G,p)
 *     
 *     dfs(G,v) {
 *       marked[v] = true;
 *       for( int n: G.adj(v) ) {
 *         if( !marked[n] ) {
 *           dfs(G,n)
 *         }  
 *       }
 *     }
 *   - need a method to get all traversable positions to (i,j) on the board
 *   - need to pass the current state of marked positions so we dont revist
 *   - need to collect all words built up over path traversal (uniquely)=hashSet
 *   - start with 2x2 custom board and dictionary of words of length 2.
 *     
 * - Prune BoggleGraph by comparing against the trie dictionary, if the
 *   dictionary doesnt have an entry with the prefix, we dont need to 
 *   continue our DFS for word paths. The great thing about tries is that
 *   descending its nodes define part of the key ie prefixes. 
 *   - Trie::longestPrefixOf(query) gives us a key in the trie thats a prefix
 *     of the query word... Not what we want.. we want the opposite. given a 
 *     prefix (ie first few letters) is there the beginnings of a word (key)
 *     in the trie? We just need to know whether we should continue looking
 *     for paths with that prefix or stop. Need to extend Trie class to add
 *     new prefixQuery() method, this amounts to checking if a subtrie exists  
 *   - Trie search hits are fast, search misses are faster yet.
 *            
 * - String vs StringBuilder
 *   - Java Strings are immutable: once created cant change, a copy is made so
 *     so concatenation O(N) while substring search O(1) -- offset into char array
 *   - Java String Builder is EFFICIENT for significant amount of contatenations
 *     as we are doing here (prefix building/reversing a string) O(1) concat
 *   
 * - Dictionary Data Type must be immutable: an object that cannot be changed
 *   programmatically; Once the constructor has completed execution, that
 *   instance can't be altered. Test11 requires a "defensive" deep copy of
 *   dictionary be done, as some of the data in there gets mutated.
