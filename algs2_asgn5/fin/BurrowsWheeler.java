 *
 * The Burrows-Wheeler compression algorithm consists of three algorithmic
 * components, which are applied in succession: Note the difference between
 * ecoding and compression. 1&2 preps the data so it can be compressed well.
 * 1. Burrows-Wheeler transform encoding: Given a typical English text file,
 *    transform it into a text file in which sequences of the same character
 *    occur near each other many times.
 * 2. Move-to-front encoding: Given a text file in which sequences of the same
 *    character occur near each other many times, convert it into a text file
 *    in which certain characters appear more frequently than others.
 * 3. Huffman compression: Given a text file in which certain characters appear
 *    more frequently than others, compress it by encoding frequently occurring
 *    characters with short codewords and rare ones with long codewords.
 *  
 *    
 * The Burrows-Wheeler decompression algorithm applies the inverse operations
 * in reverse order.
 * 1. Huffman decompression
 * 2. Move-to-front decoding
 * 3. Burrows-Wheeler transform decoding
 * 
 *  
 *
 * Burrows-Wheeler transform. 
 * The goal of the Burrows-Wheeler transform is not to compress a message, 
 * but rather to transform it into a form that is more amenable to compression. 
 * The transform rearranges the characters in the input so that there are LOTS
 * OF CLUSTERS with repeated characters, but in such a way that it is still
 * possible to recover the original input. It relies on the following intuition:
 * if you see the letters 'hen' in English text, then most of the time the
 * letter preceding it is 't' or 'w'. If you could somehow group all such
 * preceding letters together (mostly t's and some w's), then you would have
 * an easy opportunity for data compression.
 * 
 * Burrows-Wheeler encoding. 
 * The Burrows-Wheeler transform of a string s of length N is defined as follows:
 * Consider the result of sorting the N circular suffixes of s. The Burrows-Wheeler
 * transform is the last column in the sorted suffixes array t[], preceded by the
 * row number first in which the original string ends up. Continuing with the 
 * "ABRACADABRA!" example above, we highlight the two components of the
 * Burrows-Wheeler transform in the table below.

 * Since the original string ABRACADABRA! ends up in row 3, we have first = 3.
 * Thus, the Burrows-Wheeler transform is

 * Notice how there are 4 consecutive As and 2 consecutive Bs â€” these clusters
 * make the message easier to compress. This is the message we write out in HEX.

128 bits
 * Also, note that the integer 3 is represented using 4 bytes (00 00 00 03). 
 * The character 'A' is represented by hex 41, the character 'R' by 52, etc.
 * We only process 256 ASCII characters = 256 HEX chars from 00-FF.
 * Therefore the codeword width need only be 8 bits (2^8=256) / 1 byte blocks
 * 
 * NOTE: BinaryStdIn returns 8 bits as char (16-bit unsigned)
 * StdIn/StdOut reads sequences of unicode characters.
 * Use BinaryStIn/BinaryStdOut to read and write sequences of bytes.
 * Refer to Huffman.java for compress/expand examples ie:
BinaryStdOut::write(int x) {
// writes a 32 bit int into 4 bytes
// The unsigned right shift operator ">>>" shifts a zero into the leftmost position 
    writeByte((x >>> 24) & 0xff);
    writeByte((x >>> 16) & 0xff);
    writeByte((x >>>  8) & 0xff);
    writeByte((x >>>  0) & 0xff);
}
public static void write(char x) {
   if (x >= 0 && x < 256) writeByte(x);
}
public static String readString() {
    if (isEmpty()) throw new RuntimeException("Reading from empty input stream");

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    while (!isEmpty()) {
        char c = readChar();
        sb.append(c);
    }
    return sb.toString();
}    
 *
 *
 * Burrows-Wheeler decoding. 
 * Now, we describe how to invert the Burrows-Wheeler transform and recover the
 * original input string. If the jth original suffix (original string, shifted j
 * characters to the left) is the ith row in the sorted order, we define next[i]
 * to be the row in the sorted order where the (j + 1)st original suffix appears.
 * For example, if first is the row in which the original input string appears,
 * then next[first] is the row in the sorted order where the 1st original suffix
 * (the original string left-shifted by 1) appears; next[next[first]] is the row
 * in the sorted order where the 2nd original suffix appears; next[next[next[first]]]
 * is the row where the 3rd original suffix appears; and so forth.
 *    first = 3 : row in sorted order where original    string appears  (0 original)
 *  next[3] = 7 : row in sorted order where original<<1 string apppears (1 original)
 *  next[7] = 11: row in sorted order where original<<2 string appears  (2 original)
 * next[11] = 2 : row in sorted order where original<<3 string appears  (3 original)
 * etc...
 *               i = row of original suffixes (mapping)
 *    index[0] = 3  first
 *    index[1] = 7  n[first]
 *    index[2] = 11 n[n[first]]
 *    index[3] = 4  n[n[n[first]]]
 *    index[4] = 8  n[n[n[n[first]]]
 *    index[5] = 5  n[n[n[n[n[first]]]]
 *    index[6] = 9  n[n[n[n[n[n[first]]]]]
 *    index[7] = 2  n[n[n[n[n[n[n[first]]]]]]
 *    index[8] = 6  n[n[n[n[n[n[n[n[first]]]]]]]
 *    index[9] = 10 n[n[n[n[n[n[n[n[first]]]]]]]]
 *    index[10]= 1  n[n[n[n[n[n[n[n[n[first]]]]]]]]
 *    index[11]= 0  n[n[n[n[n[n[n[n[n[n[first]]]]]]]]
 * The CircularSuffixArray.index[] tracks the original row given the sorted row.
 * Inversely we want the original row number, given the sorted row.
 * ! building the next array given a row i of the sorted suffixes we can can
 *   examine the next index in this sequence to build up the next array. ie
 *   next[0] = 3
 *   next[1] = 0
 *   next[2] = 6
 *   next[3] = 7
 *   next[4] = 8
 *   next[5] = 9
 *   next[6] = 10
 *   next[7] = 11
 *   next[8] = 5
 *   next[9] = 2
 *   next[10]= 1
 *   next[11]= 4
 * ! the thing is we don't have index[i], but do have t[] (Burrow-Wheeler Xform)
 *   so can we extract index[i] from t???
 * 
 * Decoding the message given t[], first, and the next[] array: 
 * The input to the Burrows-Wheeler decoder is the last column t[] of the sorted 
 * suffixes along with first. From t[], we can deduce the first column of the
 * sorted suffixes because it consists of precisely the same characters, but in
 * sorted order.
 *

11    R ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? B        4
 *
 * Now, given the next[] array and first, we can reconstruct the original input
 * string because charAt[0] of the ith original suffix is the ith character in
 * the input string. That is, Column 0 of the cycled string is the same as the
 * original input string. In the example above, since first = 3, we know that 
 * the original input string appears in row 3; thus, the original input string
 * starts with 'A' (and ends with '!' from t[]). Since next[first] = next[3] = 7,
 * the next original suffix appears in row 7; thus, the next character in the
 * original input string is 'B'. Since next[next[first]] = next[7] = 11, the 
 * next original suffix appears in row 11; thus, the next character in the 
 * original input string is 'R'. Constructing the next[] array from t[] and 
 * first. Amazingly, the information contained in the Burrows-Wheeler transform
 * suffices to reconstruct the next[] array, and, hence, the original message! 
 * 
 * Here's how. It is easy to deduce a next[] value for a character that appears
 * !exactly once! in the input string. For example, consider the suffix that
 * starts with 'C'. By inspecting the first column, it appears 8th in the sorted
 * order. The next original suffix after this one will have the character 'C' as
 * its last character. By inspecting the last column, the next original appears
 * 5th in the sorted order. Thus, next[8] = 5. Similarly, 'D' and '!' each occur
 * only once, so we can deduce that next[9] = 2 and next[0] = 3.
 * 
 i      Sorted Suffixes     t      next
--    -----------------------      ----
 0    ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? A        3
 1    A ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? R        *
 2    A ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? D
*3    A ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? !
 4    A ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? R        * * encode MDS sorted so s[1] < s[4]

 *
 * But what about characters that appear more than once? We need to resolve this
 * ambiguity. The key rule is that If sorted row i and j both start with the same
 * character and i < j, then next[i] < next[j]. This rule implies next[10] = 1 
 * and next[11] = 4. Why is this rule valid? The rows are sorted so row 10 is 
 * lexicographically less than row 11. Thus the ten unknown characters in row 10
 * must be less than the ten unknown characters in row 11 (since both start with
 * 'R'). We also know that between the two rows that end with 'R', row 1 is less
 * than row 4. But, the ten unknown characters in row 10 and 11 are precisely the
 * first ten characters in rows 1 and 4. Thus, next[10] = 1 and next[11] = 4 or
 * this would contradict the fact that the suffixes are sorted.
 * ! the rows are cyclic, sorted or not, shifting row 10 R??????B left has to 
 * give us row 1 because sorting put it there.
 * 
 * So.. as we read in t[i] we maintain a lexicographically ordered symbol table
 * (by chars we read in) and track the positions in which we read them in a queue
 * for each char. when this is done we know how much mem to allocate for next[]
 * O(N) and simply unload all the queues we built in symbol table order.
 * 
 * ST (Transform Table)
 * [!]-[3]               next[i] = [3 0 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 2 1 4]
 * [A]-[0 6 7 8 9]
 * [B]-[10 11]
 * [C]-[5]
 * [D]-[2]
 * [R]-[1 4]
 * 
 * Our Table could be |R| (256) but its not necessary to allocate the space or
 * think about the Alphabet so much. We could also use a regular hash table and
 * sort the keys, afterwards, but why add O(NlgN) if we could/need to go linear.
 * Need A Binary Search Tree SymbolTable or better
 * - worst case w/ BST keys are already sorted so we end up with a list and d=N
 * - best case  w/ BST tree is perfectly balanced so d=ln(N) (log base 2)
 * - other tree based implementations of SymbolTables are probably smart enough
 *   to self balance when needed... Either way a tree ST is needed to preserve 
 *   the lexicographic ordering of the character keys: 
 * - java.util.TreeMap:
 *   - Red-Black Tree: sorted by natural ordering of keys
 *   - Gurarnteed log(N) for get() (as well as contains(),put(),remove())
 *   - not synchronized
 * - edu.princeton.cs.algs4.RedBlackBST
 * Also need a Queue to track positions of the data read in
 * - edu.princeton.cs.algs4.Queue:: enqueue(@tail)/dequeue(@head)
 * - java.util.Queue:: add(@tail)/remove(@head) JUST AN INTERFACE!!!
 *   - need to instantiate a concrete implementation of the interface (LinkedList) 
 *   
 * Now to reconstruct/decode the string we need the lexicographically sorted char
 * array corresponding to t. first tells us the row of the sorted suffix grid our
 * original string is on. the first column is sorted[t[i]] the last column is t[i]
 * we have these two columns now, so we know the first and last char of the original
 * message... and now need to reconstruct whats in between using the next[] array
 * 
 *   first = 3
 * next[i] = [3 0 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 2 1  4 ]
 *    t[i] = [A R D ! R C A  A  A A B  B ]
 *    s[i] = [! A A A A A B  B  C D R  R ]
 *      i     0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8 9 10 11

     * concatenations via StringBuilder, just like BinaryStdIn.readString()
     * 
     * We could read the input all at once and convert it to a char array
     *    String t = BinaryStdIn.readString();
     *    char[] s = t.toCharArray();
     * But that keeps 2 copies of the data, both of which we wont be using plus
     * it would have to be sorted O(NlgN). Suggested that KEY INDEX COUNTING
     * Radix sort could be used to sort the char array t[] into s[]... This is
     * actually linear AND stable. O(N+R) in time and O(N+R) in space. NOT NlgN.
     * It uses ~ N+R additional space, ~11N+4R array access; R = 256. 
     * Note there isnt an implementation we can use in algs4 and we get this 
     * for free by reading directly into an ordered tree data strucuture.
     * In addition, the data read in is dequeued/freed into a char[] that we
     * actually use and the number of TreeMap keys equals the number of unique
     * characters seen, which is likely considerably less than R.
